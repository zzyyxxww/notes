# Complex numbers

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form of $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is a solution of the equation $x^2=-1$.

Because no real number satisfies this equation, $i$ is called an imaginary number.

Also, $a$ is called the real part while $b$ is called the imaginary part.
